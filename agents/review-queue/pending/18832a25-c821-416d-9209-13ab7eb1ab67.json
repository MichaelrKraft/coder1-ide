We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing performance issues when working with large files. This is definitely something we'll want to look into.\n\nCould you please provide a bit more information to help us investigate further? Some details that would be helpful:\n\n- What size/type of files are you typically working with?\n- Are there any specific actions or workflows that seem to trigger the high memory usage?\n- Are you running Coder1 on a particular operating system or hardware configuration?\n\nProviding these details will really help our engineering team diagnose the problem and work towards a solution. In the meantime, you may want to try closing and reopening the IDE, or restarting your computer, to see if that provides any temporary relief.\n\nWe're committed to ensuring Coder1 delivers a smooth and efficient development experience, so please rest assured we'll investigate this issue thoroughly. We appreciate you taking the time to report it - feedback like this is invaluable for improving the product.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions! I'm here to help.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your name]\nCoder1 Community Manager",
