# Testing the /repo Command

## How to Test the New /repo Command

1. **Open the IDE**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ide
   - Wait for the terminal to connect (you'll see the prompt)

2. **Try the Help Command**
   ```
   /repo
   ```
   This will show you the help text and list of available repositories.

3. **Ask Your Philosophical Question**
   ```
   /repo What is the biggest aha you can see out of all these repos?
   ```

4. **Other Example Queries**
   ```
   /repo how to implement authentication in React
   /repo best practices for API error handling  
   /repo what are the common patterns for state management
   /repo how do modern frameworks handle routing
   ```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you type `/repo <question>`, the terminal:
1. Detects the `/repo` command
2. Transforms it to `coder1 ask-repo <question>`
3. Sends it through the WebSocket to the backend
4. The backend queries ALL 22+ pre-loaded repositories
5. Returns ranked results based on relevance

## Expected Response Format

You'll see:
- 🔍 Search progress indicator
- 🥇🥈🥉 Top ranked results from different repositories
- 📊 Confidence scores
- 🔗 Source repository links
- Code examples when relevant

## Note About Your Question

Your question "What is the biggest aha you can see out of all these repos?" is particularly interesting because it asks for meta-insights across all the repositories. The system will analyze patterns across:

- facebook/react
- vuejs/core
- vercel/next.js
- expressjs/express
- And 18+ other major frameworks

This could reveal fascinating architectural patterns and convergent evolution in modern web development!
