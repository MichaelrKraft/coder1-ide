# Streamlined Drag-Drop Test

This file tests the new streamlined workflow for sharing files with Claude Code.

## What's New?

1. **Auto-copy**: Files are automatically copied to clipboard when dropped
2. **Clean feedback**: Simple terminal message instead of verbose output  
3. **Claude-optimized content**: Content formatted specifically for Claude conversations
4. **No buttons**: Seamless drag → drop → paste workflow

## How to Test

1. Drag this file into the terminal
2. You should see: "✅ 1 file copied to clipboard → Paste in Claude Code"
3. The content should be immediately available in your clipboard
4. Paste directly into Claude Code conversation - no intermediate steps!

## Expected Results

✅ **Terminal**: Clean, minimal feedback message  
✅ **Clipboard**: Conversational content optimized for Claude  
✅ **No UI clutter**: No buttons or complex interfaces  
✅ **Smooth workflow**: Feels like drag-drop-paste instead of drag-drop-click-paste

This represents a major improvement in user experience - the technology gets out of the way and lets you focus on collaborating with Claude Code effectively.
