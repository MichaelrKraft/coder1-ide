# 🚀 Coder1 IDE Alpha Launch Guide

**Version**: Alpha 1.0  
**Launch Date**: September 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Alpha Testing

---

## 🎯 Alpha Launch Summary

Coder1 IDE is **ready for alpha launch** with core functionality fully operational. The IDE provides a complete development environment built specifically for Claude Code integration, with some advanced features temporarily disabled for stability.

### ✅ **What Works Perfectly**

#### **Core IDE Experience**
- **Monaco Editor**: Full VSCode editing experience with syntax highlighting
- **Integrated Terminal**: Complete PTY integration with WebSocket connections  
- **File System**: File operations, file tree, project navigation
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions with proper cleanup
- **Menu System**: Complete menu bar with keyboard shortcuts

#### **Claude Code Integration** 
- **Terminal Detection**: Auto-detects `claude` commands and activates learning mode
- **Context System**: Captures terminal history and file context for AI
- **Session Intelligence**: Creates session context for handoffs
- **Supervision Mode**: AI watches and assists during development

#### **Development Features**
- **Real-time Editing**: Monaco editor with full TypeScript/JavaScript support
- **Terminal Commands**: Full bash/shell command support via PTY
- **Git Integration**: Basic git status and modified file tracking
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Standard IDE shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)
- **Drag & Drop**: File drag-and-drop system for Claude Code integration

#### **UI/UX Features**
- **Responsive Design**: Three-panel layout with resizable panels
- **Dark Theme**: Professional Tokyo Night theme
- **Status Bar**: Connection status, active file, git information
- **Settings System**: Comprehensive settings with persistence

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations (Temporary)**

### **Enhanced StatusLine Components - Disabled**
**Reason**: Architectural issue with Next.js webpack compilation  
**Impact**: 7 advanced status components temporarily unavailable
**User Notice**: Clearly indicated in Settings > General and status bar

**Missing Components**:
- `model_info` - Current Claude model display
- `time_display` - Session time tracking  
- `cost_daily` - Daily API cost tracking
- `cost_live` - Live session cost tracking
- `repo_info` - Repository information display
- `commits` - Recent commits display
- `mcp_status` - MCP server status

**Why This Is Safe**: These are "nice-to-have" features that don't impact core IDE functionality.

**Resolution Plan**: Post-alpha architectural redesign to use server-side API + client-side fetch pattern.

## 🧪 **Alpha Testing Focus Areas**

### **Primary Value Validation**
1. **IDE + Terminal Integration**: Does the core editing + terminal experience feel smooth?
2. **Claude Code Workflow**: Is the `claude` command detection and context system valuable?
3. **Session Handoffs**: Can users effectively continue work with session context?
4. **File Operations**: Are file operations intuitive and reliable?

### **Performance & Stability**  
1. **Terminal Responsiveness**: PTY performance under various workloads
2. **Memory Usage**: Session cleanup and resource management
3. **WebSocket Stability**: Connection reliability during extended sessions
4. **File System Operations**: Large file handling and concurrent operations

### **User Experience**
1. **Onboarding**: How intuitive is the interface for new users?
2. **Transparency**: Do users understand the alpha limitations?
3. **Error Handling**: Are errors handled gracefully with helpful messages?
4. **Settings Persistence**: Do user preferences save and restore correctly?

## 🚀 **Quick Start for Alpha Users**

### **Access the IDE**
```bash
# Start the unified server
cd /path/to/coder1-ide-next
npm run dev

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3001/ide
```

### **Test Core Functionality**
1. **Terminal Test**: 
   ```bash
   echo "Hello Coder1"
   claude help me with this project
   ```

2. **File Operations**: 
   - Create new file (Ctrl+N)
   - Open existing files
   - Edit and save changes

3. **Session Context**:
   - Use `claude` commands in terminal
   - Verify "Learning" status appears
   - Check session intelligence is working

### **Report Issues**
- **GitHub Issues**: Primary issue tracking
- **Expected Behavior**: Core IDE functions should work reliably
- **Known Issues**: Enhanced StatusLine components are expected to be missing

## 📊 **Alpha Success Metrics**

### **Core Functionality**
- ✅ IDE loads and remains stable during 30+ minute sessions
- ✅ Terminal commands execute reliably  
- ✅ File operations work without data loss
- ✅ Claude command detection functions correctly
- ✅ Session context system provides value to users

### **User Feedback**
- **Value Proposition**: Do users find the IDE + Claude Code integration valuable?
- **Workflow Integration**: Does this improve their development process?
- **Missing Features**: Are the disabled statusline components significantly missed?
- **Performance**: Is the IDE responsive enough for daily use?

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture Status**

### **Server Architecture** 
- **Unified Next.js Server**: Single server on port 3001 ✅
- **WebSocket Integration**: Socket.IO for real-time terminal ✅  
- **PTY Management**: Node-pty for terminal sessions ✅
- **Session Management**: In-memory with cleanup ✅

### **Frontend Stack**
- **Next.js 14+**: App router with TypeScript ✅
- **React 18**: With hooks and context ✅
- **Monaco Editor**: VSCode editing engine ✅
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling ✅

### **Known Technical Debt**
- **StatusLine Components**: Webpack resolution issue requiring architectural redesign
- **Test Coverage**: Limited automated testing (manual testing focused for alpha)
- **Error Boundaries**: Could be more comprehensive
- **Performance Monitoring**: Basic logging, could be enhanced

## ⚡ **Emergency Procedures**

### **If StatusLine Components Get Re-enabled Accidentally**
```bash
# IDE will break completely - quick fix:
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/coder1-ide-next
```

Edit `lib/statusline-components/index.ts`:
```typescript
export const STATUSLINE_COMPONENTS = {
  // Keep all components commented out
  // model_info: modelInfoComponent,
  // time_display: timeDisplayComponent,  
  // etc...
} as const;
```

### **Server Won't Start**
```bash
# Kill any processes using port 3001
lsof -ti :3001 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### **Terminal Not Working**
```bash
# Check PTY support
node -e "console.log(require('node-pty'))"

# If missing:
npm install node-pty
```
