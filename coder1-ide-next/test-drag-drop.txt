This is a test file for testing the drag-drop functionality.

The fixes should:
1. Show the copy button in bottom-right of terminal (not trying to position inline)
2. Generate clean content without base64 spam
3. Keep the server stable without crashes

Test completed successfully if:
✅ Button appears in predictable bottom-right location
✅ Copied content is readable and clean
✅ No server crashes or connection lost errors
