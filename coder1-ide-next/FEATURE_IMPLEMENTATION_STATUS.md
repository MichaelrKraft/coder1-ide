# Feature Implementation Status

**Last Audit**: September 25, 2025  
**Purpose**: Track which features are real vs mock/demo implementations

## Status Legend
- ✅ **REAL**: Fully functional as advertised
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Some functionality works, some is mocked

## AI Features

### AI Team Button
- **Status**: ❌ **REMOVED**

- **Reality**: Feature no longer exists in current codebase
- **What Was**: Previously showed mock terminal output
- **Removal Date**: Before September 25, 2025
- **Notes**: Confirmed removed by user - no longer in UI

### Session Summary
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Claims**: "AI-powered development session analysis"
- **Reality**: Template-based summary with some AI enhancement
- **What Works**: Collects terminal history and file changes
- **What's Uncertain**: How much is AI vs templated
- **Files**: `/api/claude/session-summary`, `/services/SessionSummaryService.ts`

### Error Doctor
- **Status**: ❌ FAKE
- **Claims**: "AI-powered error analysis and fixes"
- **Reality**: Returns generic error suggestions
- **What's Fake**: Real Claude API integration for error analysis
- **Issues**: OAuth token vs API key confusion
- **Files**: `/services/ErrorDoctorService.ts`
- **Notes**: Route often disabled at server level

### Supervision Mode
- **Status**: ✅ REAL
- **Claims**: "AI watches and assists as you code"
- **Reality**: Functional supervision system confirmed working
- **What Works**: Keyword detection, status display, context monitoring
- **Verification**: Confirmed working by Claude Code agent (Sept 24, 2025)
- **Files**: `/contexts/SupervisionContext.tsx`
- **Notes**: Previously misassessed - system is actually functional

### PRD Generator
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Claims**: "AI-powered requirements generation"
- **Reality**: Mix of templates and optional AI enhancement
- **What Works**: 5-question flow, brief generation
- **What's Uncertain**: AI involvement level
- **Files**: `/smart-prd-generator-standalone.html`

## Infrastructure Features

### Claude CLI Bridge
- **Status**: ✅ REAL
- **Claims**: "Direct Claude CLI integration"
- **Reality**: Functional with proper OAuth configuration
- **What Works**: Direct Claude CLI communication, authentication
- **Verification**: Tested and confirmed working by agent (Sept 24, 2025)
- **Files**: `/services/claude-cli-bridge.ts`
- **Notes**: Previously misassessed - system works when properly configured

### Context Memory System
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Claims**: "Learning from development patterns"
- **Reality**: Sophisticated logging with basic pattern detection, NOT learning
- **What Works**: SQLite database, conversation storage, rule-based pattern detection
- **What's Missing**: AI/ML analysis, embeddings, actual learning from patterns
- **Technical Details**: Detects command sequences, error→solution patterns, file groupings
- **Files**: `/services/context-database.ts`, `/services/context-processor.ts`
- **Investigation**: September 25, 2025 - confirmed no ML/intelligence layer
- **Pattern**: Infrastructure exists but learning engine was never implemented

### Parallel Development (Claude Tabs)
- **Status**: ❌ **REMOVED**
- **Claims**: "Multiple Claude instances working in parallel"
- **Reality**: Feature no longer exists in current codebase
- **What Was**: Previously showed multiple terminal tabs
- **Removal Date**: Before September 25, 2025
- **Notes**: Confirmed removed by user - no longer in current implementation

### Component Capture
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Claims**: "Capture and reuse React components"
- **Reality**: Basic screenshot/code capture
- **What Works**: Screenshot capture, code storage
- **What's Missing**: Intelligent component extraction
- **Files**: `/components-capture.html`

## Mock Service Patterns

### Common Mock Patterns Found
```typescript
// Fake async operations
setTimeout(() => {
  this.status.installed = true;
  this.emit('install:complete');
}, 3000); // Just waits, does nothing

// Hardcoded demo results
if (query.includes('auth')) {
  return DEMO_AUTH_RESULTS;
}

// Fake progress indicators
let progress = 0;
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  progress += Math.random() * 15;
  this.emit('progress', progress);
}, 500);
```

### localStorage Fake Flags
Many features check localStorage for fake status:
- `deepcontext-installed`
- `deepcontext-indexed`
- `ai-team-configured`
- `supervision-enabled`

## Recommendations for Cleanup

### High Priority (User-Facing Deception)
1. **File Search**: ✅ Already renamed for honesty
2. **AI Team Button**: Add "Demo Mode" label or fix
3. **Error Doctor**: Either implement or remove
4. **Supervision Mode**: Clarify it's just keyword detection

### Medium Priority (Partial Implementations)
1. **Session Summary**: Document what's real vs templated
2. **Context Memory**: Verify if actually learning
3. **PRD Generator**: Clarify AI involvement level

### Low Priority (Backend Infrastructure)
1. **Claude CLI Bridge**: Document OAuth requirements
2. **Component Capture**: Works enough for basic use
3. **Parallel Tabs**: Users understand it's just tabs

---

## Testing Checklist

To verify a feature's real implementation:

### 1. Network Test
- Open DevTools Network tab
- Use the feature
- Check for actual API calls vs localStorage

### 2. Offline Test
- Disconnect internet
- If feature still works identically, it's likely fake

### 3. Source Code Check
- Look for `setTimeout` with no real operation
- Search for "mock", "demo", "fake", "TODO"
- Check for hardcoded responses

### 4. Progress Bar Test
- If progress bar always takes same time regardless of input
- If progress increments are too regular
- Likely fake progress

### 5. Error Injection Test
- Provide invalid input
- If it still "succeeds", it's fake
- Real implementations fail on bad input

## Integrity Commitment

This document exists to:
1. Build trust through transparency
2. Guide future development priorities
3. Prevent wasted debugging of fake features
4. Set realistic user expectations
5. Document technical debt honestly

**Remember**: A working simple feature is better than a complex fake one.
