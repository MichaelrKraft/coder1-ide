## ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

### **1. Enhanced StatusLine Components**
**Status**: üî∂ **TEMPORARILY DISABLED**

**Issue**: Architectural problem with Next.js webpack compilation  
**Impact**: 7 advanced status components unavailable:
- `model_info` - Current Claude model display
- `time_display` - Session time tracking
- `cost_daily` - Daily API cost tracking  
- `cost_live` - Live session cost tracking
- `repo_info` - Repository information display
- `commits` - Recent commits display
- `mcp_status` - MCP server status

**Safety Assessment**: "Nice-to-have" features that don't impact core IDE functionality  
**Resolution Plan**: Post-alpha architectural redesign using server-side API + client-side fetch

### **2. Terminal Scrolling Issue**  
**Status**: üî∂ **WORKAROUND ACTIVE**

**Issue**: Terminal text cuts off at bottom, cannot scroll to see all output  
**Current Solution**: 200px padding workaround creates black buffer zone  
**Location**: `/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx` lines 2222-2229  
**Test**: Run `for i in {1..50}; do echo "Line $i"; done` - Can you see line 50?
