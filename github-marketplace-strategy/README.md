## ⚡ Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
- **100M+ developers** on GitHub
- **CodeRabbit precedent**: $550M valuation in 2 years
- **Unique positioning**: ONLY IDE for Claude Code CLI users
- **Perfect timing**: AI coding revolution + Claude Code growth

### The Strategy
1. **FREE Forever IDE** - Full features, no limitations
2. **$29/month Eternal Memory** - The one feature nobody else has
3. **GitHub Marketplace** - Zero customer acquisition cost
4. **Viral PRD Generator** - Broader funnel than competitors

### Key Differentiators
- ✅ **Works with Claude Code CLI** (Cursor/Windsurf use expensive APIs)
- ✅ **Eternal Memory Persistence** (Nobody else has this)
- ✅ **Zero API Costs** (Uses local CLI, not tokens)
- ✅ **Free Forever IDE** (Full features, no limitations)

### Expected Outcomes
- **Month 1**: 1,000 users, 100 paying ($2,900 MRR)
- **Month 6**: 15,000 users, 1,500 paying ($43,500 MRR)
- **Year 1**: 50,000 users, 5,000 paying ($145,000 MRR)
- **Year 2**: 200,000 users, 20,000 paying ($580,000 MRR)
- **Year 3**: 1M+ users, 100,000 paying ($2.9M MRR)

## 🎬 Quick Start for Agents

### If you're implementing GitHub OAuth:
```bash
# Start here
open 05-GITHUB-APP-SETUP.md
open 06-OAUTH-IMPLEMENTATION.md
cd code-templates
cat github-oauth.ts
```

### If you're building Demo Mode:
```bash
# Start here
open 07-DEMO-MODE.md
cd code-templates
cat demo-mode.tsx
```

### If you're creating the browser extension:

## 🚀 Why This Strategy Will Work

### 1. Proven Playbook
CodeRabbit achieved $550M valuation in 2 years through GitHub Marketplace. We're following their exact distribution strategy with better differentiation.

### 2. Unique Market Position
We're the ONLY IDE that works with Claude Code CLI. Cursor and Windsurf require expensive API tokens. We use what developers already have.

### 3. Compelling Free Tier
Unlike competitors who limit features, we give away the entire IDE free. Users only pay for the one unique feature: eternal memory.

### 4. Built-in Virality
- PRD Generator attracts non-developers
- "Built with Coder1" attribution
- "Open in Coder1" buttons everywhere
- Social sharing built-in

### 5. Perfect Timing
- Claude Code is exploding in popularity
- Developers frustrated with API costs
- AI coding is becoming mainstream
- GitHub Marketplace is proven channel
