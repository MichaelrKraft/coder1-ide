## üì¢ **LAUNCH COMMUNICATIONS**

### **Twitter Launch Thread**
```
üöÄ LAUNCHING: Coder1 Alpha

The first web IDE where Claude never forgets your context.

We just solved the "web-to-local" problem that has plagued web IDEs for years.

üßµ Thread: How we built the future of AI-powered development...

1/8 The Problem: AI coding tools lose context between sessions. You waste time re-explaining your codebase every conversation.

2/8 The Vision: What if Claude remembered EVERYTHING across sessions? Your code, your patterns, your preferences.

3/8 The Solution: Coder1 bridges your local Claude CLI to a professional web IDE. Best of both worlds.

4/8 The Innovation: Our Bridge architecture enables zero API costs + complete privacy + enterprise security.

5/8 The Experience: Professional Monaco editor + integrated terminal + persistent AI memory = productivity superpowers.

6/8 The Economics: Free alpha, $29/month pro. No AI API costs means premium features at affordable prices.

7/8 The Launch: Alpha starts TODAY. First 50 developers get lifetime early adopter benefits.

8/8 Join the future: https://coder1.app/alpha

### **HackerNews Post**

Title: "Show HN: Coder1 ‚Äì Web IDE where Claude never forgets your context"

We built the first web IDE specifically for Claude Code users. Our Bridge architecture connects your local Claude CLI to a professional web IDE, solving the "web-to-local" problem that has plagued web IDEs for years.

Key innovations:
‚Ä¢ Zero API costs (uses your existing Claude subscription)
‚Ä¢ Complete privacy (all AI processing local)
‚Ä¢ Persistent memory (Claude remembers across sessions)
‚Ä¢ Enterprise security (ticket-based authentication)

The architecture: Web IDE ‚Üî Local Bridge ‚Üî Claude CLI

This enables professional web development with full AI integration while maintaining privacy and avoiding ongoing API costs.

Alpha launching today: https://coder1.app/alpha

Would love feedback from the HN community!
