# üöÄ Coder1 Commercial Launch - Implementation Complete

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Beta Launch  
**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.0 - Claude CLI Edition

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Coder1 has been successfully transformed from an API-dependent prototype into a commercial-ready IDE for Claude Code CLI users. The platform now monetizes through memory persistence and productivity features rather than AI API access.

**Key Achievement**: Users bring their own Claude Code CLI, we provide the memory layer that makes Claude never forget.
