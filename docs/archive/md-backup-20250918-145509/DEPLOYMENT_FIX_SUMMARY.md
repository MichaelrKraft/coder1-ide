# Interactive Tour Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tour Highlighting Not Visible
**Problem**: Turquoise border glow highlights weren't showing in production
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
- Missing `pulse` animation keyframes in CSS
- No backdrop overlay for contrast
- Z-index stacking context issues

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `@keyframes pulse` animation to `globals.css`
- Added semi-transparent backdrop overlay (`bg-black/50`) at z-index 9998
- Positioned highlight boxes at z-index 9999 (above overlay)
- Added subtle background to highlight boxes for better visibility
- Added all required classes to Tailwind safelist for production

### 2. Preview Panel Error
**Problem**: "File not found" error showing in preview panel
**Root Cause**: Code was trying to set `activeFile` to non-existent `demo.tsx`
**Solution**: Removed the `setActiveFile('demo.tsx')` call - panel now shows default demo

## Files Modified

1. **`app/globals.css`**
   - Added `@keyframes pulse` animation for highlight pulsing effect

2. **`components/InteractiveTour.tsx`**
   - Added backdrop overlay div for contrast
   - Updated z-index values (overlay: 9998, highlights: 9999, tooltip: 10000)
   - Added subtle background to highlight boxes
   - Added `tour-tooltip` class for better identification

3. **`tailwind.config.ts`**
   - Added backdrop and tour classes to safelist:
     - `bg-black/50`
     - `fixed`, `inset-0`, `pointer-events-none`
     - `tour-tooltip`

4. **`app/ide/page.tsx`**
   - Kept `setActiveFile('demo.tsx')` commented out (already fixed)

## Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Build for production
npm run build

# 2. Test locally in production mode
npm run start

# 3. Deploy to Render
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Interactive tour highlighting and preview panel for production"
git push origin refactor/clean-phase1

# Render will auto-deploy from the pushed branch
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Tour starts when clicking "Take Tour" button
- [ ] Dark backdrop overlay appears (50% opacity)
- [ ] Turquoise highlight boxes appear around elements
- [ ] Highlights have pulsing animation
- [ ] Tooltip is visible above everything
- [ ] Preview panel shows demo graphic (no error)
- [ ] Preview panel stays functional after tour completes

## Technical Details

The solution uses a "floating boxes" approach:
- Highlight boxes are separate divs that track target element positions
- Updates every 100ms to handle layout changes
- Exists in tour's stacking context (above page content)
- Bypasses any z-index issues with page elements

This approach is more reliable than trying to style the actual elements because it avoids stacking context limitations.
