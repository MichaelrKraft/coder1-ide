# CoderOne IDE Dropdown Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This document provides critical guidance for Claude agents working on dropdown functionality in the CoderOne IDE, particularly around menu dropdowns and settings modal-to-dropdown conversion.

## Critical Issues Encountered

### 1. Build System CSS Problems

**Problem**: CSS changes in source files not reflected in built application
- CSS modifications to `MenuBar.css` and `SettingsDropdown.css` were not included in production builds
- Even after successful builds, served CSS files contained old styles
- Webpack/Craco aggressive caching prevented style updates

**Symptoms**:
- Changes visible in source files but not in browser
- Network tab shows correct build file names but wrong CSS content
- `position: fixed` changes appearing as `position: absolute` in served files

**Solutions**:
- Clear build cache: `rm -rf build node_modules/.cache`
- Use `NODE_ENV=production npm run build` for consistent builds
- Verify changes in served files via `curl http://localhost:3000/ide/static/css/main.*.css`

### 2. Server File Serving Architecture

**Problem**: Hardcoded HTML in server bypasses normal file resolution
- Server has two code paths: Vercel mode (hardcoded HTML) vs Local mode (dynamic)
- File hash changes require manual updates to hardcoded HTML in `src/app.js` lines 731-732
- Even in local mode, the server modifies served HTML

**Critical Files**:
- `src/app.js` lines 599-635: Vercel mode hardcoded HTML
- `src/app.js` lines 636-671: Local mode with dynamic file reading

**Required Updates After Build**:
```javascript
// Update these lines in src/app.js with new build hashes:
src="/ide/static/js/main.NEWHASH.js?cb=${cacheBuster}"
href="/ide/static/css/main.NEWHASH.css?cb=${cacheBuster}"
```

### 3. Component Architecture Interference

**Problem**: Adding SettingsDropdown broke existing menu dropdowns
- MenuBar restructuring with React Fragments caused event handling issues
- Shared CSS classes and z-index conflicts
- Event propagation problems between different dropdown systems

**Root Cause**: 
- CSS `.menu-dropdown` positioning was changed from `absolute` to `fixed`
- Parent container `overflow: hidden` clipped absolute positioned dropdowns
- Component event handlers interfered with each other

### 4. CSS Override Catastrophe

**Problem**: Broad CSS selectors caused orange highlighting everywhere
- Override CSS file had selectors that were too broad
- `!important` rules affected unintended elements
- Global styles interfered with Monaco editor and terminal components

**Never Do This**:
```css
/* This broke everything */
* { 
  background: orange !important; 
}
```

## Working Solutions

### For Menu Dropdowns

The existing menu dropdowns work because they use:
```css
.menu-dropdown {
  position: absolute;  /* NOT fixed */
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1000;
}
```

### For Header Overflow Issues

The header has `overflow: hidden` which clips absolutely positioned elements. Solutions:
1. Use `position: fixed` with calculated viewport positioning
2. Move dropdown outside header container
3. Change header to `overflow: visible` (may break other layouts)

### Proper Build Deployment Process

1. Make source changes
2. Clear build cache: `rm -rf build node_modules/.cache`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Note new file hashes: `ls build/static/js/main.*.js build/static/css/main.*.css`
5. Update hardcoded HTML in `src/app.js` with new hashes
6. Deploy: `cp -r build/* ../../public/ide/`
7. Restart server
8. Verify in browser dev tools that correct files are loaded

## Red Flags for Future Agents

**Immediate Stop Signs**:
- Orange highlighting appears when clicking anywhere ❌
- Menu dropdowns (File, Edit, View, Run, Help) stop working ❌
- Build succeeds but changes not visible in browser ❌
- CSS changes in source files but not in served files ❌

**When You See These, Revert Immediately**:
```bash
# Emergency revert process
rm -rf build node_modules/.cache
git checkout -- src/components/MenuBar.tsx src/components/MenuBar.css
# Remove any new SettingsDropdown files
npm run build
# Update app.js with new hashes
# Deploy and restart server
```

## Recommended Approach for Settings Dropdown

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Study existing `MenuBar.tsx` dropdown implementation
- Copy exact CSS patterns from `.menu-dropdown`
- Understand current `SettingsModal.tsx` content structure

### Phase 2: Minimal Implementation
- Create `SettingsDropdown` that mirrors menu dropdown CSS exactly
- Use same positioning logic as existing dropdowns
- Keep `MenuBar` structure intact - only change settings button behavior

### Phase 3: Incremental Testing
- Test settings dropdown in isolation first
- Verify menu dropdowns still work after each change
- Use browser dev tools to prototype positioning before coding

## Key Files and Their Roles

- `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` - Main menu bar with dropdown logic
- `src/components/MenuBar.css` - Critical dropdown positioning styles
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Current modal to be replaced
- `src/app.js` - Server file serving with hardcoded HTML
- `public/ide/index.html` - Template HTML (often bypassed)

## Testing Checklist

Before considering any dropdown work complete:
- [ ] Menu dropdowns (File, Edit, View, Run, Help) work properly
- [ ] Settings dropdown appears under settings button
- [ ] No orange highlighting or global style issues
- [ ] Dropdowns position correctly on different screen sizes
- [ ] Build deploys changes successfully
- [ ] Server serves correct file hashes

## Emergency Contacts

If you encounter issues beyond this guide:
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for build system documentation
- Look for similar patterns in existing working dropdowns
- When in doubt, revert and try a more minimal approach
