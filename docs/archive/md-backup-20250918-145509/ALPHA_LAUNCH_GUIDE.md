üöÄ LAUNCH: Coder1 Alpha is here!

The first web IDE where Claude never forgets your context.

üßµ Thread: Why this changes everything for developers...

1/7 The Problem: Current AI coding tools lose context between sessions. You spend time re-explaining your codebase every time.

2/7 The Solution: Coder1 bridges your local Claude CLI to a professional web IDE. Claude remembers EVERYTHING across sessions.

3/7 The Architecture: Your CLI ‚Üí Local Bridge ‚Üí Web IDE. Zero API costs, complete privacy, enterprise security.

4/7 The Experience: Professional Monaco editor + integrated terminal + persistent AI memory = productivity superpowers

5/7 The Business Model: Free alpha, $29/month pro. No AI API costs means we can offer premium features affordably.

6/7 The Innovation: We solved the "web-to-local" problem that has plagued web IDEs for years. This is genuinely new.

7/7 The Launch: Alpha starts today. First 50 developers get lifetime early adopter benefits.
