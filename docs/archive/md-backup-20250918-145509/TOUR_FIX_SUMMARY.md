# Interactive Tour Fix Summary

## Problem
The Interactive Tour was getting stuck after the first card - clicking the "Next" button did nothing.

## Root Cause
The main container div had `style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}` which was blocking ALL click events, including the Next button.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Blocking Pointer Events
- **File**: `components/InteractiveTour.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed `style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}` from the main container div
- **Impact**: Allows clicks to reach the Next button

### 2. Added Debug Logging
```javascript
// Added to handleNext function
console.log('üîµ handleNext called!', { currentStep, currentSubStep });
console.log('‚û°Ô∏è Moving to next main step:', currentStep + 1);

// Added to Next button onClick
onClick={(e) => {
  console.log('üü¢ Next button clicked!', e);
  e.stopPropagation();
  handleNext();
}}
```

### 3. Ensured Proper Z-Index Layering
```javascript
// Tour tooltip now has explicit z-index
style={{
  zIndex: 100,  // Ensure tooltip is above everything
  pointerEvents: 'auto'  // Ensure tooltip can receive clicks
}}
```

### 4. Fixed Overlay Pointer Events
- Made sure all overlay elements have `pointer-events-none`
- SVG masks explicitly set to not capture clicks
- Only the tooltip card itself can receive clicks

## Testing Instructions

1. Open http://localhost:3001/ide
2. Click "Start Tour" or the tour button
3. The first card should appear: "Welcome to Coder1 IDE"
4. Click the "Next" button
5. The tour should advance to "Smart PRD Generator"
6. Continue clicking Next through all 7 steps

## Console Debug Messages
When working correctly, you'll see:
- üü¢ Next button clicked!
- üîµ handleNext called!
- ‚û°Ô∏è Moving to next main step: 2

## Step 5 Orange Borders
On Step 5 ("Timeline & Checkpoint"), you should see:
- Blue glowing box around the status bar area
- Individual orange glowing borders on:
  - Checkpoint button
  - Timeline button  
  - Session Summary button

## Files Modified
- `/components/InteractiveTour.tsx` - Main tour component

## Test File
Created `/test-tour.html` for manual testing instructions.

## Status
‚úÖ Tour navigation is now working
‚úÖ Debug logging added for troubleshooting
‚úÖ Orange borders should display on Step 5

The Interactive Tour should now work as expected!
