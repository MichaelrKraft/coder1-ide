## 🔄 Voice-to-Claude Workflow

### Complete Integration Flow
```
1. User clicks microphone button (🎙️)
2. Speech recognition activates
3. User says "run claude" or similar command
4. Voice command is processed and mapped to action
5. Terminal receives command via WebSocket or simulation
6. Claude Code CLI is launched
7. Visual feedback provided throughout process
```

### Supported Voice Commands
| Voice Input | Action | Terminal Output |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| `"run claude"` | `run-claude` | Executes `claude\r` |
| `"open claude"` | `run-claude` | Executes `claude\r` |
| `"start claude"` | `run-claude` | Executes `claude\r` |
| `"type [command]"` | `terminal-input` | Executes `[command]\r` |
| `"enter [command]"` | `terminal-input` | Executes `[command]\r` |
| `"clear"` | `clear-terminal` | Clears terminal screen |
| `"help"` | `help` | Shows voice commands help |
| `"sleep mode"` | `toggle-sleep` | Toggles sleep mode |
| `"supervision"` | `toggle-supervision` | Toggles supervision mode |
| `"hivemind"` | `open-hivemind` | Opens hivemind dashboard |

## 🏗️ Architecture Integration

### Component Relationships
```
App.tsx
  └── Terminal.tsx
      ├── VoiceInterface.tsx (in header-left)
      ├── xterm.js (terminal content)
      └── WebSocket connection (backend integration)
```

### Data Flow
```
VoiceInterface → handleVoiceCommand() → sendToTerminal() → WebSocket/Simulation
                                    ↓
                            writeToTerminal() → Visual feedback
```

### State Management
- Voice interface state (listening, processing, error)
- Terminal connection state (connected, disconnected)
- Command processing state (executing, completed)
- UI integration state (sleep mode, supervision, etc.)

---

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### Visual Integration
- **Location**: Voice interface in terminal header-left section
- **Size**: Compact 40px button with status display
- **Colors**: Tokyo Night theme compliance
- **Animations**: Pulse effect during listening, spin during processing
- **Feedback**: Real-time status text and transcript display

### Interaction Design
- **Primary**: Push-to-talk interaction model
- **Secondary**: Click to activate, release to process
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized button sizing
- **Error Handling**: Clear error states and recovery options
