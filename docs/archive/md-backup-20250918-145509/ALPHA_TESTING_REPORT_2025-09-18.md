3. **No Success Indicators** (Impact: -10% conversion)
   - Users unsure if bridge connected successfully
   - No visual confirmation in browser
   - Silent failures possible

#### 🟡 MEDIUM FRICTION (Should Address)
1. **Claude CLI Dependency** (Impact: -8% conversion)
   - Requires existing Claude Code subscription
   - Additional $20-40/month cost not clear upfront
   - OAuth setup complexity

2. **Documentation Gaps** (Impact: -5% conversion)
