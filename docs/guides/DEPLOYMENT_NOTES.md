# Coder1 Platform - Deployment Notes

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Repository Confusion
**Issue**: Multiple repositories with similar names caused confusion
- `autonomous_vibe_interface` (local directory)
- `coder1-ide` (GitHub repo)
- `Coder1-Platform` (GitHub repo connected to Render)

**Solution**: Identified that Render is connected to `Coder1-Platform` repository

### 2. Failed to Fetch Errors
**Issue**: "Failed to start infinite loop: Failed to fetch" errors persisted for 8+ hours

**Root Causes**:
1. The `InfiniteLoopManager` service had dependencies that failed to initialize
2. When routes failed to load, the entire `/api/infinite/*` endpoints were unavailable
3. React app had hardcoded `localhost:3002` URLs
4. URL truncation bug: `/api/infinite` â†’ `/api/i.e`

**Solutions**:
1. Created `infinite-loop-simple.js` - a mock implementation without external dependencies
2. Updated `app-simple.js` to use the simple version with fallback
3. Created `api-config.js` to intercept and fix API URLs at runtime
4. Added better error logging to identify issues faster

### 3. Missing UI Controls
**Issue**: No visible way to stop a running infinite loop session

**Solution**: Added dynamic stop button that appears when session starts

## Key Files Modified

1. **`src/routes/infinite-loop-simple.js`** - Mock implementation without dependencies
2. **`src/app-simple.js`** - Updated to load simple routes with better error handling
3. **`ide-build/static/api-config.js`** - Fixes hardcoded URLs in React build
4. **`ide-build/static/api-injection.js`** - Enhances terminal buttons with API calls
5. **`ide-build/index.html`** - Includes api-config.js before React bundle

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Ensure all npm dependencies are in package.json
- [ ] Test routes load without errors: `node test-routes.js`
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded localhost URLs in production code
- [ ] Check that mock/fallback implementations exist

### Render Configuration
- Repository: `Coder1-Platform`
- Branch: `main`
- Build Command: `npm install` (or `npm run build` if needed)
- Start Command: `npm start` (runs `node server.js`)
- Environment Variables: None required for mock mode

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check health endpoint: `curl https://coder1-platform.onrender.com/health`
2. Test API endpoints:
   ```bash
   # Test infinite loop
   curl https://coder1-platform.onrender.com/api/infinite/health
   
   # Test starting a session
   curl -X POST https://coder1-platform.onrender.com/api/infinite/start \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command":"test"}'
   ```

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Browser Cache Issues**:
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Clear site data in DevTools

**API Connection Errors**:
- Check browser console for exact error
- Verify API URL doesn't contain `localhost`
- Check Network tab for failed requests

**Route Loading Failures**:
- Check Render logs for initialization errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Use simple/mock implementations as fallback

## Architecture Notes

### Dual Implementation Strategy
- **Production**: Simple mock implementations that always work
- **Development**: Full implementations with real services
- Graceful fallbacks prevent total failures

### API URL Resolution
- React build process hardcodes API URLs
- `api-config.js` intercepts and fixes URLs at runtime
- Removes need to rebuild React app for URL changes

### Session Management
- In-memory storage for demo/mock mode
- Sessions auto-expire after 20 components (safety feature)
- Manual stop available via API or UI button

## Future Improvements

1. **Environment-based Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for API URLs
   - Separate dev/staging/production configs

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry logic
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Real Claude Integration**
   - Fix InfiniteLoopManager initialization
   - Add API key management
   - Enable actual code generation

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Integrated stop button in main UI
   - Session history viewer
   - Progress indicators

## Monitoring

- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Monitor logs for route loading errors
- Watch for 404 errors on API endpoints
- Track browser console errors from users
