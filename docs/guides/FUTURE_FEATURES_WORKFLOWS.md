✅ Beautiful Dashboard:
   - Located at: /workflow-dashboard
   - 6 workflow cards with controls
   - Real-time status monitoring
   - Settings and configuration panels
```

### What's Needed (2-3 Hours)

```javascript
// 1. Create /src/routes/workflows.js (100 lines)
const { WorkflowEngine } = require('../workflows/engine/WorkflowEngine');
const engine = new WorkflowEngine();

router.post('/execute-template', async (req, res) => {
    const result = await engine.executeTemplateWorkflow(req.body);
    res.json({ success: true, result });
});

// 2. Uncomment in app.js (Line 481)
app.use('/api/workflows', require('./routes/workflows'));

// 3. Test & Deploy
```

---

## 📋 Quick Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Route Handler (45 minutes)
```bash
# Create the route file
touch src/routes/workflows.js

# Add the basic structure:
- POST /api/workflows/execute-template
- GET /api/workflows/health
- GET /api/workflows/list
```

### Step 2: Connect Engine (15 minutes)
```javascript
// Initialize the existing engine
const { WorkflowEngine } = require('../workflows/engine/WorkflowEngine');
const engine = new WorkflowEngine({
    maxConcurrent: 10,
    debug: true
});
```

### Step 3: Enable Route (5 minutes)
```javascript
// In src/app.js line 481, uncomment:
app.use('/api/workflows', require('./routes/workflows'));
```

### Step 4: Test (30 minutes)
- Visit http://localhost:3000/workflow-dashboard
- Click "Start Workflow" on any card
- Verify execution and results
