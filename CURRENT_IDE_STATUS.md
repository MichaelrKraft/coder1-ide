# 🎯 CURRENT IDE STATUS 

**Last Updated**: August 31, 2025  
**Updated By**: Claude Code Agent (fixing terminal input regression)

---

## ✅ **ACTIVE IDE (USE THIS ONE)**

**📂 Directory**: `/coder1-ide-next/`  
**🔧 Technology**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + React 18  
**🌐 URL**: `http://localhost:3000/ide`  
**🚀 Start Command**: `cd coder1-ide-next && npm run dev`

### **Why This IDE:**
- ✅ **Rebuilt from the ground up** (as mentioned by user)
- ✅ **Has "Discover panel in the lower left-hand corner"** (user verification)
- ✅ **Modern Next.js architecture** with API routes
- ✅ **Active development** - this is where current work happens

---

## ❌ **DEPRECATED IDEs (DON'T USE THESE)**

### 1. `/coder1-ide/coder1-ide-source/` ⚠️ DEPRECATED
- **Technology**: React 18 + TypeScript  
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001` (when running)
- **Status**: ❌ **OUTDATED** - Was the "standardized" version in January 2025 but superseded
- **Problem**: User moved to Next.js rebuild, this is legacy

### 2. All other IDE directories ⚠️ DEPRECATED  
- **Locations**: `/coder1-ide/`, `/coder1-tauri/`, etc.
- **Status**: ❌ **ARCHIVED** - Various experiments and old versions

---

## 🚨 **FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENTS - READ THIS FIRST**

### **Before Working on IDE:**
1. ✅ **ALWAYS** check this file first for current IDE location
2. ✅ **USE**: `/coder1-ide-next/` directory only
3. ✅ **START**: `cd coder1-ide-next && npm run dev`
4. ✅ **ACCESS**: `http://localhost:3000/ide`

### **DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use `/coder1-ide/coder1-ide-source/` (it's deprecated)
- ❌ Assume port 3001 is current (it's the old React version)
- ❌ Follow `IDE_STANDARDIZATION.md` (it's outdated from Jan 2025)
- ❌ Use any other IDE directories without checking this file

## 🔍 **HOW TO VERIFY CORRECT IDE**

### **Visual Confirmations:**
1. **Browser Title**: Should say "Coder1 IDE - AI-Powered Development Environment"
2. **Discover Panel**: Should have "Discover" section in lower-left with compass icon
3. **URL**: Should be `http://localhost:3000/ide` (NOT 3001)
4. **Technology**: Should show Next.js in developer console, not React development

### **If Confused:**
```bash
# Quick verification script
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface
ls -la | grep "coder1-ide"
# You should see: coder1-ide-next (CURRENT) and coder1-ide (DEPRECATED)
```

## 📚 **DOCUMENTATION STATUS**

### ✅ **UPDATED** (Reflects Current Next.js IDE):
- `CURRENT_IDE_STATUS.md` (this file)
- User testing and verification

### ⚠️ **OUTDATED** (Still References Old React IDE):
- `IDE_STANDARDIZATION.md` - Says React version is standard (WRONG)
- `CORRECT_IDE_VERSION.md` - References React build files (WRONG)
- `CLAUDE.md` deployment instructions - May reference old paths

### 📝 **TODO**: Update all outdated documentation to reflect Next.js current standard

## 🎯 **TERMINAL INPUT ISSUE - RESOLVED**

**Issue**: Terminal was not accepting input after agent changes  
**Cause**: Complex scroll detection logic interfered with terminal focus  
**Resolution**: Reverted to simple terminal data handling  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Terminal should accept typing again

**For Future Agents**: Don't add complex scroll detection to working terminals!

## 🚀 **QUICK START FOR AGENTS**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to current IDE
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/coder1-ide-next

# 2. Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev

# 4. Access IDE
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/ide

# 5. Verify it's working
# - Should be able to type in terminal
# - Should see "Discover" panel in lower-left
# - Should see Next.js assets in network tab
```
