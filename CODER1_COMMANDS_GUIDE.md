# Coder1 Terminal Commands - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Coder1 IDE includes a revolutionary repository intelligence system that provides instant AI-powered analysis of GitHub repositories through simple terminal commands. These commands offer a hidden competitive advantage - appearing as basic terminal operations while running sophisticated intelligence algorithms underneath.

## Command Format

All commands follow the pattern: `coder1 [command] [parameters]`

## Core Repository Commands

### 1. Repository Analysis

#### `coder1 analyze-repo [repository-url]`
Analyzes a GitHub repository and provides instant AI intelligence about its structure, patterns, and best practices.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 analyze-repo https://github.com/facebook/react
```

**Output:** Comprehensive analysis including project structure, key components, patterns used, and suggestions.

#### `coder1 ask-repo [question]`
Ask questions about the currently analyzed repository.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 ask-repo "How does the useState hook work internally?"
```

#### `coder1 list-repos`
Lists all repositories that have been analyzed and are available in the intelligence cache.

#### `coder1 repo-status`
Shows the status of the currently active repository including cache status and available intelligence.

### 2. Code Intelligence

#### `coder1 explain-code [file-path]`
Provides detailed explanation of code in a specific file.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 explain-code src/components/Terminal.tsx
```

#### `coder1 find-pattern [pattern-name]`
Searches for specific design patterns or code patterns in the analyzed repository.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 find-pattern "singleton"
coder1 find-pattern "observer pattern"
```

#### `coder1 suggest-improvements [file-path]`
Analyzes code and suggests improvements based on best practices from popular repositories.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 suggest-improvements src/services/api.js
```

#### `coder1 generate-tests [file-path]`
Generates test cases for the specified file based on the code structure.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 generate-tests src/utils/validators.js
```

## Pre-loading Management Commands

### 3. Pre-loading Status

#### `coder1 preload-status`
Shows the current status of repository pre-loading including progress and statistics.

**Output Example:**
```
Pre-loading Status:
‚úÖ Active: Yes
üìä Progress: 12/21 repositories (57%)
‚è±Ô∏è Elapsed: 5m 32s
üíæ Memory: 423MB used
```

#### `coder1 preload-list`
Lists all pre-loaded repositories available for instant analysis.

#### `coder1 preload-start`
Manually starts the pre-loading process (usually automatic on server startup).

#### `coder1 preload-stop`
Stops the pre-loading process if running.

#### `coder1 preload-add [repository-url]`
Adds a new repository to the pre-loading queue.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 preload-add https://github.com/vercel/next.js
```

## Popular Repository Commands

### 4. Trending & Popular Repositories

#### `coder1 preload-popular`
Shows the most popular GitHub repositories based on stars and recent activity.

**Output Example:**
```
üìà Top Popular Repositories:
1. freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp - ‚≠ê 426,005 stars
2. codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x - ‚≠ê 411,812 stars
3. sindresorhus/awesome - ‚≠ê 393,010 stars
```

#### `coder1 preload-trends`
Shows trending repositories and changes in popularity.

#### `coder1 preload-refresh`
Refreshes the dynamic list of popular repositories from GitHub.

#### `coder1 preload-analytics`
Shows usage analytics including which repositories are most frequently analyzed.

## Automation Commands

### 5. Intelligent Automation

#### `coder1 auto-suggest [enable|disable]`
Enables or disables automatic code suggestions based on repository intelligence.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 auto-suggest enable
```

#### `coder1 auto-complete [enable|disable]`
Toggles intelligent auto-completion using repository patterns.

#### `coder1 watch-patterns`
Monitors your coding patterns and suggests optimizations from popular repositories.

## Configuration Commands

### 6. System Configuration

#### `coder1 config memory-limit [MB]`
Sets the maximum memory usage for repository caching.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 config memory-limit 1000  # Set to 1GB
```

#### `coder1 config preload-delay [seconds]`
Sets the delay before automatic pre-loading starts.

#### `coder1 config batch-size [number]`
Sets how many repositories to pre-load simultaneously.

## Advanced Commands

### 7. Deep Analysis

#### `coder1 architecture [repository-url]`
Provides architectural analysis of a repository.

#### `coder1 dependencies [repository-url]`
Analyzes and explains the dependency structure.

#### `coder1 security-scan [repository-url]`
Performs security pattern analysis based on best practices.

## Help & Information

### 8. Help Commands

#### `coder1 help`
Shows all available commands with brief descriptions.

#### `coder1 help [command]`
Shows detailed help for a specific command.

**Example:**
```bash
coder1 help analyze-repo
```

#### `coder1 version`
Shows the current version of the repository intelligence system.

## Usage Tips

### Performance Optimization

1. **Pre-loaded repositories respond instantly** (< 1 second)
2. **Non-pre-loaded repositories** take 30-60 seconds on first analysis
3. **Enable dynamic pre-loading** to automatically cache trending repositories

### Best Practices

1. **Start with pre-loading** - Let the system pre-load popular repositories on startup
2. **Add your frequently used repos** - Use `preload-add` for repositories you work with often
3. **Monitor usage** - Check `preload-analytics` to see usage patterns
4. **Optimize memory** - Adjust memory limits based on your system

### Configuration for Maximum Performance

```bash
# Enable all dynamic features
coder1 config dynamic-preload enable
coder1 config user-patterns enable
coder1 config auto-refresh enable

# Set optimal resource limits
coder1 config memory-limit 2000  # 2GB
coder1 config batch-size 5       # Process 5 repos at once
```

## Competitive Advantages

This system provides several hidden advantages:

1. **60x faster analysis** - Instant vs 30-60 seconds
2. **Network effects** - Each user's patterns help all users
3. **Self-improving** - Gets smarter with usage
4. **Hidden sophistication** - Complex AI appears as simple terminal commands

## API Endpoints

For programmatic access, the following REST endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/repository-admin/preload/status` - Pre-loading status
- `POST /api/repository-admin/preload/start` - Start pre-loading
- `GET /api/repository-admin/popular` - Get popular repositories
- `GET /api/repository-admin/analytics` - Usage analytics
- `GET /api/repository/status` - Repository analysis status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-loading not starting:**
- Check memory availability with `coder1 preload-status`
- Ensure minimum 500MB free memory
- Try manual start with `coder1 preload-start`

**Commands not recognized:**
- Ensure terminal is connected to Coder1 IDE
- Check server is running on port 3000
- Verify WebSocket connection is active

**Slow analysis:**
- Repository may not be pre-loaded
- Add to pre-load queue with `coder1 preload-add`
- Check network connectivity

## Future Enhancements

Planned features include:
- Team repository sharing
- Custom intelligence models
- IDE plugin integration
- Real-time collaboration insights
