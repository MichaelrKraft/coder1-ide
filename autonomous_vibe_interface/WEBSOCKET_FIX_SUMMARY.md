# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The terminal was stuck on "Connecting to terminal server..." despite both servers running properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After deep investigation, the root cause was identified as **duplicate Socket.IO connection handlers**:
- **Location**: `src/app.js` lines 71-103
- **Issue**: A global `io.on('connection')` handler was consuming all incoming connections
- **Impact**: The terminal-specific WebSocket handler never received connection events

## Solution Applied
1. **Commented out the duplicate handler** in `src/app.js:71-103`
2. **Merged voice handling** into the terminal WebSocket setup in `terminal-websocket-safepty.js`
3. **Preserved all functionality** while fixing the connection conflict

## Code Changes

### src/app.js (lines 68-104)
```javascript
// IMPORTANT: This handler has been disabled to fix WebSocket connection issues
// Voice and terminal events are now handled in terminal-websocket-safepty.js
/*
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log(`Voice client connected: ${socket.id}`);
    // ... (handler code commented out)
});
*/
```

### src/routes/terminal-websocket-safepty.js (lines 293-304)
```javascript
// Handle voice events (moved from app.js)
socket.on('voice:join_session', (data) => {
    if (data.sessionId) {
        socket.join(`session:${data.sessionId}`);
        const client = connectedClients.get(socket.id);
        if (client) {
            client.sessionId = data.sessionId;
        }
        socket.emit('voice:session_joined', { sessionId: data.sessionId });
        console.log(`[SafePTYManager] Voice session joined: ${data.sessionId}`);
    }
});
```

## Verification
Server logs confirm successful operation:
- Multiple terminal sessions created successfully
- Proper rate limiting working (preventing PTY exhaustion)
- Clean session management and cleanup
- Both voice and terminal events handled correctly

## Test Results
✅ Terminal WebSocket connection established  
✅ Terminal sessions creating successfully  
✅ Rate limiting working to prevent PTY exhaustion  
✅ Voice events properly handled alongside terminal  
✅ Claude button integration ready for testing  

## Next Steps
With the WebSocket connection fixed, the Claude Code button integration can now be fully tested:
