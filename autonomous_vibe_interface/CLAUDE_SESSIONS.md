# üìö Claude Session Continuity Guide

## Quick Start: How to Continue Previous Work in New Claude Conversations

When starting a new Claude Code conversation, you can reference your previous development sessions stored in CoderOne's Documentation Intelligence System.

## üéØ The Problem This Solves

Claude Code doesn't maintain context between conversations. When you start a new chat, Claude doesn't know about:
- What you built yesterday
- Bugs you fixed last week  
- Features you were implementing
- Errors you encountered and resolved

**CoderOne's Session Storage fixes this!**

## üìÅ Where Sessions Are Stored

Your session summaries are automatically stored at:
```
/Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/
```

Each session is saved as a JSON file with a unique ID like `session_1234567890_abc123.json`

## üöÄ How to Reference Previous Sessions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TOKEN WARNING
**Important**: Loading session summaries DOES consume Claude's context tokens!
- Each session can use 1,000-5,000+ tokens
- Loading all sessions might use significant context
- This leaves less room for your actual work

### Method 1: Simple Hook Command (NEW! ‚ú®)
```bash
# Load ALL sessions (use carefully - high token usage):
Read /sessions

# Better: Load recent sessions only:
Read /sessions-recent

# Best: Load specific session by search:
"Load my session about WebSocket implementation"
```

### Method 2: Manual Load (Fallback Method)
```bash
# If the hook isn't set up, use this longer command:
"Please read my previous development sessions from /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/
Look for session files (they start with session://) and help me continue where I left off."
```

### Method 3: Reference Specific Work
```bash
# If you remember what you were working on:
"Check /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/ for my session about fixing the WebSocket bug"

# Or by time:
"Read yesterday's session summary from /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/"
```

### Method 4: Use the Helper Tool
Visit: http://localhost:3000/claude-session-helper.html
- Search through your sessions
- Generate copy-paste commands for Claude
- Find specific session IDs

## üìù What's In Each Session Summary

Each stored session includes:
- **Session Information**: Date, type (bug-fix, feature, testing), duration
- **Work Completed**: What was accomplished
- **Files Modified**: Which files were changed
- **Terminal Commands**: Commands that were run
- **Errors Encountered**: Problems and how they were solved
- **Next Steps**: What should be done next
- **Technical Notes**: Important implementation details

## üí° Best Practices for Token Management

### üéØ Smart Session Loading (Save Your Tokens!)

1. **Don't Load Everything**: 
   - ‚ùå BAD: `Read /sessions` (might use 30,000+ tokens)
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: `"Read my most recent session about authentication"`

2. **Be Specific**: 
   - ‚ùå BAD: Loading 10 sessions "just in case"
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Load only the 1-2 sessions relevant to current work

3. **Use Search First**:
   ```bash
   # Instead of loading all sessions:
   "Search my sessions for WebSocket errors, then load only that session"
   ```

4. **Load Progressively**:
   ```bash
   # Start conversation light:
   "What sessions do I have about authentication?"
   # Then load specific one:
   "Load session_1234567890_auth.json"
   ```

5. **Extract Key Parts**:
   ```bash
   "Read only the 'Next Steps' section from my last session"
   ```

### üìä Token Usage Examples

| Action | Approximate Tokens | Context Remaining |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Load 1 session | ~2,000 tokens | 198,000 |
| Load 5 sessions | ~10,000 tokens | 190,000 |
| Load 10 sessions | ~20,000 tokens | 180,000 |
| Load ALL (20+) | ~40,000+ tokens | 160,000 ‚ö†Ô∏è |

### üöÄ Optimal Workflow

1. **Start Light**: Begin conversation without loading sessions
2. **Identify Need**: Determine what previous context is needed
3. **Load Specific**: Load only the relevant session(s)
4. **Work Efficiently**: Use remaining context for actual development

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Creating a Project Context File
You can create a master context file that references all your sessions:

```bash
# In your project root, create CONTEXT.md:
"My recent work is documented in /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/
Key sessions:
- Authentication system: session_[id]
- Bug fixes: session_[id]
- UI improvements: session_[id]"
```

### Automated Context Loading
Add to your `.claude/config` (future feature):
```json
{
  "autoLoadSessions": true,
  "sessionPath": "/Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/"
}
```

## üéØ Example Workflow

1. **Day 1**: Work on authentication feature
   - Generate session summary
   - Click "Store in Docs"
   - Session saved as `session_1234567890_auth.json`

2. **Day 2**: New Claude conversation
   - Start with: "Read session_1234567890_auth.json from /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/"
   - Claude now knows exactly where you left off
   - Continue building with full context

3. **Day 3**: Debug an issue
   - Tell Claude: "Check my sessions for any WebSocket-related work"
   - Claude finds and references relevant sessions
   - Problem solved faster with historical context

## üö® Important Notes

- Sessions are stored locally on your machine
- They are NOT sent to Claude's servers automatically
- You must explicitly tell Claude to read them
- The more specific you are, the better Claude can help

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Can't find sessions?**
- Check the directory exists: `ls -la /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/`
- Make sure you've stored at least one session
- Verify the server is running on port 3000

**Claude can't read the files?**
- Ensure you're using the full absolute path
- Check file permissions
- Make sure you're in a Claude Code environment with file access

**Sessions not appearing in helper?**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the API is running: http://localhost:3000/api/docs/health

## üìö Quick Reference Card

```bash
# SIMPLEST METHOD - Just type:
Read /sessions

# Or if hook not installed, use:
"Please read my previous development sessions from /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface/data/documentation/ and help me continue where I left off."
```
