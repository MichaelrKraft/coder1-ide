# ‚ö†Ô∏è PTY EXHAUSTION ISSUE HAS RETURNED

The terminal connection is failing because macOS cannot create PTYs again.

## Error Details:
- Error: `forkpty(3) failed`
- This is a **system-level issue**, not a code problem
- The exact same issue from earlier has recurred

## Why This Happens:
1. macOS has limits on pseudo-terminal (PTY) resources
2. These resources can get exhausted by:
   - Orphaned terminal processes
   - IDEs and terminal apps not cleaning up properly
   - System not releasing PTY resources

## Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Kill Orphaned Processes (Try First)
```bash
# Find and kill orphaned PTY processes
ps aux | grep -E "node.*pty|bash.*defunct|zsh.*defunct" | grep -v grep
# Then kill any suspicious processes with: kill -9 <PID>
```

### Option 2: Restart Terminal Apps
1. Quit all terminal applications (Terminal.app, iTerm2, VS Code, etc.)
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Try again

### Option 3: System Restart (Most Reliable)
1. Save all work
2. Restart your Mac
3. After restart, the PTY resources will be cleared

## After Fixing:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface
./start-server.sh
```

2. The server should show it's running on port 10000

3. In your Tauri app, the terminal should connect and show "üü¢ Connected"

## Prevention:
- Always properly close terminal sessions
- Use the "Close Session" button when done
- Don't repeatedly create sessions without closing them

## Quick Test After Fix:
```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use v20.19.3
node test-pty.js
```

If this shows "‚úÖ PTY created successfully!", then the terminal will work.
