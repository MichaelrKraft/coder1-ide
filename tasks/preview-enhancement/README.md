# Preview Component Enhancement Project

## Overview

Transform the Coder1 IDE Preview Component from a static placeholder into a revolutionary visual development environment that surpasses traditional code editors like Cursor through real-time component visualization and AI-powered development workflows.

## Current State

The Preview component (`/coder1-ide/coder1-ide-source/src/components/Preview.tsx`) is currently a placeholder showing static text:
- Shows "Component preview will appear here"
- Instructs users to "Use /ui commands in the terminal" 
- No actual functionality implemented
- Positioned in right panel of three-panel IDE layout

## Vision: Beyond Cursor's Capabilities

### Core Competitive Advantages
1. **Real-Time Visual Feedback** - See component changes as you type
2. **Multi-Agent AI Development** - Collaborative AI agents for different aspects
3. **Natural Language Component Generation** - `/ui create modern pricing card`
4. **Interactive Development Environment** - Click preview to edit code
5. **Professional UI/UX Tools** - Built-in accessibility, performance, testing

### Key Differentiators vs Cursor
- **Visual-First Development** (Cursor is text-focused)
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** (Cursor has single AI)
- **Real-Time Component Preview** (Cursor requires external browser)
- **Integrated Design Tools** (Cursor lacks design system integration)
- **AI-Powered UI Generation** (Cursor does general code completion)

## Implementation Strategy

### Confidence Level: 85-90%
High confidence based on:
- Strong existing architecture foundation
- Isolated implementation scope (Preview component only)
- Proven technical patterns from CodeSandbox, Storybook
- Incremental development approach
- Comprehensive error handling strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phase-based rollout** with feature flags
- **Error boundaries** prevent system crashes
- **Iframe sandboxing** isolates preview from main IDE
- **Easy rollback** capability if issues arise
- **Performance monitoring** throughout development

## Quick Start for Future Agents

### File Locations
- **Current Preview Component**: `/coder1-ide/coder1-ide-source/src/components/Preview.tsx`
- **Terminal Integration**: `/coder1-ide/coder1-ide-source/src/components/Terminal.tsx`
- **Project Documentation**: `/tasks/preview-enhancement/`

### Development Approach
1. **Read implementation-phases.md** for detailed breakdown
2. **Review technical-architecture.md** for code patterns
3. **Check risk-assessment.md** for mitigation strategies
4. **Start with Phase 1** (basic iframe preview)
5. **Use feature flags** for safe deployment

### Key Commands to Implement
```bash
/ui create [description]     # Generate component from natural language
/ui variant [changes]        # Create component variations
/ui optimize                 # Performance and accessibility improvements
/ui responsive              # Mobile/tablet optimizations
/ui test                    # Generate component tests
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic React component renders in preview iframe
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing IDE functionality
- [ ] Error handling prevents crashes
- [ ] Feature can be toggled on/off safely
- [ ] Performance impact < 10% on IDE startup

### Long-term Success Criteria
- [ ] 10x faster UI component development workflow
- [ ] AI agents successfully collaborate on component creation
- [ ] Natural language generates production-ready components
- [ ] Professional accessibility and performance testing integrated
- [ ] Design system integration and consistency enforcement

## Getting Started

1. **Read all documentation** in this directory
2. **Start with Phase 1** implementation
3. **Test thoroughly** before proceeding to next phase
4. **Update documentation** as you build
5. **Communicate progress** and blockers

## Contact & Collaboration

This project is designed for seamless handoff between AI agents. Each document contains detailed specifications and decision rationale to ensure consistent implementation across different development sessions.

**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation
