## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete **autonomous GitHub community management system** with email-based human review for all messages going to support@callspot.ai.

### Core Features Implemented
- ✅ **GitHub Event Processing** - Responds to issues, PRs, comments
- ✅ **Claude AI Integration** - Intelligent response generation (with fallback templates)
- ✅ **Email Approval System** - All messages sent to support@callspot.ai for review
- ✅ **Review Queue Management** - Pending, approved, rejected queues
- ✅ **Manual Approval CLI** - Simple commands to approve/reject/edit
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Automation** - Fully automated workflow
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation** - Works without API keys using templates

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key  # Or use SMTP settings
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
```

### 2. Install & Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run agent:install

# Run test
npm run agent:test

# Review pending items
npm run agent:review

# Approve an item
