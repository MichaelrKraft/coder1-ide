# ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKEND SERVER NOT RUNNING!

The terminal is showing "Disconnected" because the backend server is not running on port 10000.

## Start the Backend Server NOW:

Open a **new terminal window** and run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface
./start-server.sh
```

OR if that doesn't work:

```bash
cd /Users/michaelkraft/autonomous_vibe_interface
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use v20.19.3
node src/app.js
```

## What You Should See:

When the server starts successfully, you should see:
```
Starting server with Node v20.19.3
Server listening on http://localhost:10000
[TERMINAL WS] WebSocket server setup complete
```

## After Starting the Server:

1. Keep that terminal window open (server needs to stay running)
2. Go back to your Tauri app browser window
3. Refresh the page (Cmd+R)
4. The terminal should now show "üü¢ Connected" instead of "üî¥ Disconnected"

## Quick Verification:

Once the server is running, you can verify it's working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok","port":10000}`

## Important Notes:
- The server MUST be running for the terminal to work
- Keep the server terminal window open
- If you close the server, the terminal will disconnect
