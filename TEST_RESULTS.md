# Coder1 IDE Alpha Launch Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-09-03T00:35:00Z  
**System Status:** STABLE âœ…  
**Alpha Ready:** YES ðŸŽ‰  

## Test Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Express Backend (3000) | âœ… HEALTHY | All endpoints responding |
| Next.js Frontend (3001) | âœ… HEALTHY | UI loading correctly |
| StatusBar Buttons | âœ… WORKING | All API calls successful |
| Sessions Tab | âœ… WORKING | API proxy routing correctly |
| Terminal/Microphone | âœ… WORKING | Clean output implemented |
| WebSocket Connection | âœ… ACTIVE | Real-time communication |
| Environment Config | âœ… VALIDATED | All variables correct |
| Cache Management | âœ… CLEARED | No stale data |

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Fixes Were Breaking

### 1. **Cache Issues (Primary Cause)**
- Next.js development server was caching old builds
- Changes to API routes weren't taking effect
- **Solution:** Automatic cache clearing in startup scripts

### 2. **Port Configuration Confusion** 
- Some agents were confused about which server handles what
- API routes were sometimes calling wrong ports
- **Solution:** Clear documentation and validation scripts

### 3. **Agent Coordination Issues**
- Multiple agents modifying files simultaneously
- No lock mechanism to prevent conflicts
- **Solution:** Implemented lock file system

## Stability Improvements Implemented

### ðŸš€ Scripts Created
- `./scripts/startup.sh` - Clean startup with port management
- `./scripts/stop.sh` - Graceful shutdown 
- `./scripts/health-check.sh` - Comprehensive system validation
- `./scripts/lock-system.js` - Agent coordination
- `./scripts/validate-env.js` - Environment validation

## Conclusion

**ðŸŽ‰ SYSTEM IS ALPHA-READY**

The instability issues have been resolved. System is now stable and reliable.
